# tic-tac-toe

This was an assignment I did in grade 12.

Everyone knows what tic-tac-toe is.

This requires two people to play this.

There are 2 really noticeable bugs in this game:
1. You have to first click restarted before playing the game because the buttons are set to off by default.
2. I forgot to set the text fields displaying the scores to not editable, so you can change the text and it will stay until the round is over.
